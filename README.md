Includes code used to generate results in Machine Learning for Animal Movement.

1. Derived variables: Gives code to generate derived variables from raw movement data

2. Random Forest, NN, RNN, LSTM: These folders give code to generate 1 step ahead and 1000 steps ahead simulations for individual level and colony level movement models. Code for tuning each model is also given.

3. SDE: Code for generating one step ahead and 1000 steps ahead simulation for the custom constructed Stochastic Differential Equation model.

4. Generate Metrics: This folder gives code for generating metrics on the 1000 steps ahead simulation for each model. It also gives code for plotting results using ggplot2 in R.

5. Gulls folder gives code for the analysis of the Gulls migratory data.
